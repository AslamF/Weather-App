# Weather-App

## Description
This is the the first project working with API's, the API's used were, openweather and GIPHY. The code heavily relies on the use of fetch, catch and try, and proper use of asynchronous functions. The user is allowed to type in any city or country and receive weather data for that locaiton and a GIF to accompany said weather. The data shown is all obtained from the API, however what is shown is limited. This was an initial project working with APIs but in the future would like to work on a larger scale project and more intricate API usage.
